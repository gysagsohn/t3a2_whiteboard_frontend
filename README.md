# T3A2 Whiteboard Scheduler Frontend

This is the frontend for my T3A2 MERN full stack web application. This project serves as the interface for managing operators, assets, clients, and allocations in a scheduling system. The application is designed with React and implements various features such as authentication, CRUD operations, and responsive design.

### Deployment
- The frontend has been deployed using **Netlify**.

### Project Overview
This application allows users to manage scheduling information for operators, assets, clients, and allocations through a user-friendly interface. The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs to perform CRUD operations.

## Packages Used
- **React**: Core framework for building the user interface.
- **React Router DOM**: For handling routing and navigation between pages.
- **React Modal**: For implementing modals on the login and signup pages.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
- **CORS**: To enable cross-origin resource sharing between the frontend and backend.
- **React Icons**: For adding icons (GitHub, LinkedIn) to the contact page.

## Routes/Pages
The application is divided into several pages, each accessible through specific routes:

- **Dashboard Page** (`/`): Home page displaying a summary of allocations, assets, clients, and operators.
- **Login Page** (`/login`): Allows users to log in; redirects to the dashboard upon successful login.
- **Operator Page** (`/operator`): Manage operators, including creating, updating, and deleting operator records.
- **Asset Page** (`/asset`): Manage assets with options to create, update, and delete asset records.
- **Client Page** (`/client`): Manage client information with full CRUD functionality.
- **Allocation Page** (`/allocation`): Manage allocations, including assigning assets and operators to clients.
- **User Page** (`/user`): Manage user details; currently allows editing and deleting user profiles.
- **Contact Page** (`/contact`): Displays contact information with links to GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.

## Contexts
- **Authentication Context**: Used to manage user authentication state across the application, ensuring only authenticated users can access certain pages.

## Data Management
The application handles the following data entities, each corresponding to specific pages:
- **Login**: Authenticates users and manages session tokens.
- **Operator**: Handles data related to operators, including license classes and available days.
- **Asset**: Manages assets, including asset types and registration information.
- **Client**: Manages client information and associated projects.
- **Allocation**: Manages the allocation of assets and operators to clients.
- **User**: Handles user profiles, allowing updates to user details.

## Components
The application is built with reusable components to enhance maintainability and scalability:
- **NavBar**: A responsive navigation bar that includes links to different pages and a logout button. It dynamically changes color based on the current active page.
- **Header**: Contains the applicationâ€™s logo and a link back to the dashboard.
- **Button**: Customizable buttons used throughout the application, with styles that change on hover and active states.

## Styling (CSS)
The application uses a modular CSS approach, with separate files for each component and page:
- **Global Styles** (`global.css`): Contains the base styles for the entire application, including typography and colors.
- **Button Styles** (`buttons.css`): Defines the styles for primary, secondary, and disabled buttons.
- **Page-Specific Styles**: Each page has its own CSS file to handle unique styling needs:
  - `dashboardPage.css`
  - `operatorPage.css`
  - `assetPage.css`
  - `clientPage.css`
  - `allocationPage.css`
  - `userPage.css`
  - `contactPage.css`
- **Responsive Design**: CSS media queries are used to ensure the application is fully responsive and usable on different screen sizes.

## Functional Overview
The application is designed with the following functionalities:
- **Authentication**: Users must log in to access most of the pages. JWT tokens are stored in local storage to maintain sessions.
- **CRUD Operations**: Each data entity (operator, asset, client, allocation, user) can be created, read, updated, and deleted through the respective pages.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, with layouts adjusting for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
- **Modals**: The login and signup forms are displayed in modals, providing a smooth user experience without navigating away from the current page.

## Future Enhancements
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Implement a theme toggle that allows users to switch between dark and light modes.
- **User Profile Page**: Add a dedicated page for users to view and edit their profiles.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improve error messages and feedback to users during operations like login and data submission.
- **Improved Accessibility**: Ensure all components and pages are fully accessible to users with disabilities, following WCAG guidelines.

## Additional Development Testing Recommendations
To achieve 90% test coverage, consider the following additional testing:

- **Unit Testing**: Implement unit tests for individual components using a testing framework like Jest.
- **Integration Testing**: Test the interaction between different components and the backend API.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Use a tool like Cypress to simulate user interactions and test the entire workflow from login to CRUD operations.
- **Error Handling Testing**: Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for different types of failures, such as network errors or invalid inputs.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Ensure the application works consistently across different browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

This enhanced testing strategy will help ensure that all aspects of the application function as expected and provide a better user experience.
